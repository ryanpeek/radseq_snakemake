## General `vim` Notes


Some use tips and tricks. See [here](https://ryanpeek.org/radseq/background_bash.html)

```
:set nu  # set line numbers
:tabnew  # start a new tab
gt   # scroll between tabs
GG   # go to bottom of file
gg   # go to top of file

yy #yank
dd #delete
d$ #delete to end of line from where cursor currently is

```

To switch between different tabs:

```
gt
```

To keep vim open: `Ctrl + z`, and return or reopen: `gt`
