## General `vim` Notes


Some use tips and tricks. See [here](https://ryanpeek.org/radseq/background_bash.html)

```
:set nu  # set line numbers
:tabnew  # start a new tab
gt   # scroll between tabs
GG   # go to bottom of file
gg   # go to top of file

yy #yank
dd #delete
d$ #delete to end of line from where cursor currently is

```

To switch between different tabs:

```
gt
```

To keep vim open: `Ctrl + z`, and return or reopen: `gt`

## Column Wise Edits

 - Move cursor to location you want to work from
 - Press `Ctrl + v` 
 - then mark across the column you want to edit 
 - Use `shift + g` to move to bottom, `gg` to top
    - `Shift + i` to insert text at the beginning of the column
    - `Shift + a` to append text,
    - `r` to replace highlighted text, 
    - `d` to delete, 
    - `c` to change
  - Press escape when done
